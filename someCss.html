They are salty while rivers and lakes are fresh water. When salty water from the ocean mixes with fresh water, a special place called an estuary is formed.

                    There are four major oceans, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian and Arctic (listed in decreasing order of size). The Pacific Ocean is the largest and covers a third part of the Earth. There are few major rivers flowing into the Pacific Ocean because it is surrounded by mountain ranges.
                    
                    The Atlantic is the second largest ocean and many large rivers flow into the Atlantic carrying sediment from land. The Indian Ocean is the third largest ocean, covering about 20% of the Earth’s water surface. The Arctic Ocean is the smallest ocean and it is located entirely in the North Polar Region.
                    
                    The largest sea is the South China Sea. People have used the oceans and seas for food and transportation for thousands of years. One way to explore the oceans is by scuba diving. Another way is to use a sub­marine like the Alvin. Scientists use an instrument called a CTD instrument to measure the salinity, temperature and density of the water. They can use the CTD instrument without ever going in the water.</p>
